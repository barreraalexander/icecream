# icecream

Hi! Let's start by getting this code downloaded to you machine. 

Open up the program called: Git Bash

Once you open it, you'll be looking at a terminal. Go ahead and make a new folder and use it as your working directory with the following commands:
mkdir github
cd github

Text me when you have that ready or if you have problems :)


👉 NEXT COMMAND: git clone https://github.com/barreraalexander/icecream.git

👉 Next set of steps:
  1. download vs code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  2. if you still have git bash open, close it and reopen it (after you have completely install vscode)
  3. go back to the repository with the commands `cd github`, then `cd icecream`.
  4. type pwd and make sure your working directory is icecream (our repository)
  5. type the command `code .`
  6. vscode should automatically open, if it doesn't, get just have to do some configuring.
  7. let me know if you have any problems :)
